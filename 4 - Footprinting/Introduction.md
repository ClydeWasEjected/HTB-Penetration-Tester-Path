## Enumeration Principles
Enumeration is a term in cybersecurity that stands for information gathering using active and passive methods. OSINT is an independent procedure and it should be performed separately from enumeration because "OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gathering"

**Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.**

- What can we see?
- What reasons can we have for seeing it?
- What image does what we see create for us?
- What do we gain from it?
- How can we use it?
- What can we not see?
- What reasons can there be that we do not see?
- What image results for us from what we do not see?

| **`No.`** | **`Principle`**                                                        |

| 1.        | There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.         |
| 2.        | Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.                |
| 3.        | There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target. |
